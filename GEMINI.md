## Project Overview

### Core Mandates

1 - **Strict Scope Adherence:** Do not fix unrelated bugs, refactor code, or change naming conventions outside the explicit scope of the user's request, even if you find errors. If you
discover critical issues that block the requested task, report them to the user and ask for permission before proceeding
2 - **Strict Scope Adherence:** Focus exclusively on the user's request. Do not fix unrelated bugs, refactor code, or change naming conventions unless explicitly asked. If a deviation
adds significant value or is critical, ask for permission first.
3 - **Think Before You Act:** DO NOT RUSH. Analyze the request, reason through the solution, and plan your steps. If a request is vague, ask for clarification. Only proceed with
implementation when the path is clear and agreed upon.
4 - **Verify Assumptions:** Never guess APIs or library functionality. Always read documentation or search for examples before writing code. "Sloppy solutions" based on assumptions are
strictly forbidden.
5 - **Context Awareness:** Understand the project's existing architecture and conventions before making changes. Your goal is to provide high-quality, integrated code that respects the
current codebase.

#### Planner Mode

- Breakdown the feature into Phases and provide a clear plan of action.
- Breakdown Phases into small tasks and provide a clear plan of action.
- Consider break tasks into subtasks.
- Create a `.md` file for the plan. Store in the `/docs/plans` folder.
- Fprmat

## Next Steps

```

- Once you finish a task, ask user to review your work.
- Wait for user's confirmation before proceeding to the next task.
- Be patient and don't rush into fixes and implementations.
- Be ready to do fixes.
- Once confirmed by the user, mark the current sub-task or task as done.
- If you need to do a fix, mark the current sub-task or task as in progress.
